It will ingest the documentation (tutorials, how to guides, etc), as well as the source code, and Jupyter notebooks that contain examples of how to use the library. I am trying to decide what framework to use for the RAG system. My default choice is to use LangChain, as I am very familiar with it. Are there any alternative RAG frameworks that I should consider? That have better features? That are significantly faster to implement? In particular, please consider Haystack and LlamaIndex. Which is likely to give the best performance with a simple implementation? Which is likely to give the best results with minimal data cleaning? Which is likely to give the best results with a more thorough implementation?\"\n",

I need to create multiple versions of the prompt, create a dataset with inputs and expected outputs, and then run evals on the different versions of the prompt. I typically use LangChain and LangGraph, so I am thinking that I will use LangSmith for the evals. Please help me to understand how to do prompt engineering and evals with Langsmith. In this use case the input is text and the output is a boolean and text. The main goal is to evaluate the boolean, but I also eventually want to write an evaluator for the text output. Please carefully research the LangSmith docs and help me understand how to do this\"\n",
    "# query = \"I am making a RAG tool. I want to be able to query the documentation of a particular library. The site is static, so I wrote a scrapy scraper to get the data. Now I'm wondering whether to use Haystack or LangChain to create the RAG system. I have an implementation for each, so the main question is which will give me the best results with the least amount of work. I am not worried about cost or particularly about latency. The goal is to get as good an answer as possible. I'm thinking I'll use o1-preview to do the retrieval. If I used Haystack, I'd basically create a pipeline that takes the output of the scraper, cleans it, splits it, creates embeddings, and then writes it to a vector database. If I used LangChain, I'd probably start by using the BSHTMLLoader (beautiful soup html loader) to load the data, then split it, create embeddings, and write to a vector database. Later I'd add more features to each like re-ranking etc. What are the pros and cons of each approach? What are the tradeoffs? Which is likely to give better performance up front when I make a quick implementation? Which is likely to give better performance with a more thorough implementation?\"\n",

       "\n",
       "### Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "Exa.ai is a new search engine offering both proprietary neural search and industry-standard keyword search. It excels in finding precise web content, retrieving clean/rich web content, and identifying similar pages based on input URLs ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Features\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Neural Search Technology**: Uses transformers for semantic understanding, handling complex queries based on meaning ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "- **Instant Content Retrieval**: Instantly returns clean and parsed content for any page in its index ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "- **Large-Scale Searches**: Capable of returning thousands of results for automatic processing, ideal for batch use cases ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pros and Cons\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pros:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- Optimized for AI applications, enhancing AI models, chatbots, and research automation ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "- Automatically selects the best search type (neural or keyword) based on the query for optimal results ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Cons:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- As a relatively new tool, it may still be undergoing development and refinement ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comparative Analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "### Capabilities and Features\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tavily**: Offers a specialized search API with efficient integration capabilities, making it ideal for applications requiring quick and accurate results. Its Python SDK and automated research features enhance its usability for AI developers ([aipure.ai](https://aipure.ai/products/gpt-researcher); [askai.glarity.app](https://askai.glarity.app/search/What-is-Tavily-and-how-does-it-function-as-a-search-engine-for-AI-agents)).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **SearXNG**: Focuses on privacy and customization, allowing users to aggregate search results from multiple engines without tracking or data storage. However, it requires manual handling of embeddings for LLM integration ([github.com](https://github.com/miurla/morphic/issues/34)).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Exa.ai**: Leverages neural search technology for semantic understanding, providing precise and relevant results. Its ability to handle large-scale searches and instant content retrieval makes it suitable for enhancing AI models and research automation ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Comprehensiveness and Accuracy\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tavily**: Known for delivering quick and accurate results, Tavily is well-suited for data analysis, content creation, and academic research ([askai.glarity.app](https://askai.glarity.app/search/What-is-Tavily-and-how-does-it-function-as-a-search-engine-for-AI-agents)).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **SearXNG**: While comprehensive in aggregating results from multiple engines, its accuracy depends on the customization and configuration by the user ([github.com](https://github.com/miurla/morphic/issues/34)).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Exa.ai**: Excels in accuracy through its neural search technology, providing high-quality results based on the semantic understanding of queries ([exa.ai](https://exa.ai/faq)).\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recommendation\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the analysis, **Exa.ai** emerges as the most suitable tool for general-purpose web search integration with LLMs. Its advanced neural search capabilities, ability to handle complex queries, and optimization for AI applications make it a powerful choice for developers seeking to enhance their LLMs with real-time, factual information. While Tavily offers efficient integration and accurate results, Exa.ai's comprehensive features and semantic understanding provide a more robust solution for diverse applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The integration of web search capabilities with LLMs is crucial for enhancing their performance and accuracy. Tavily, SearXNG, and Exa.ai each offer unique features and capabilities, catering to different needs and preferences. For developers prioritizing advanced search capabilities and semantic understanding, Exa.ai is the recommended choice. However, Tavily remains a strong contender for those seeking efficient integration and quick results. SearXNG, with its privacy-focused approach, is ideal for users who prioritize customization and data protection.\n",
