  "query": "I want to create a RAG tool that can ingest the documentation for a Python library, as well as source code and Jupyter notebooks. I am a developer, but I also want to do this quickly. What is the best RAG tool for this task? I am considering using Haystack, LlamaIndex, or LangChain. Please start by identifying if there are any other RAG frameworks that I should consider. Then, please research each framework, and explain what role it plays in a RAG toolchain. How do they compare to each other? What features does each framework offer, and how do they compare to each other? Then, please explain the pros and cons of each framework, and provide a recommendation. Finally, please show what an implementation would look like for each of the top 3 frameworks.",
